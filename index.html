Comments: It wasn't difficult for most of the part but had a little
trouble aligning the footer navigation text and links to the left.
I looked up at a couple of CSS trick website and somehow managed to
align them to the left. I think I need to face more issues in order
to get used to it. I see more CSS things coming up so probably more
experience will let me more confidence in coding eventually.
I try to use the command terminal often to add, commit, but sometimes
I forgot to do so, when often looking up on the web for problem solutions
and trying to play around and experiment the problem. At the end
the CSS file was kind of messy but try to get the common parts into
a single line so the code would look somewhat cleaner.
I think I did ok but please let me know if there are details that I
can improve. Thanks, Shigeki -->
